Koplewitz
Determine the corank distribution of bipartite graphs alpha=1, for a variety of n and p.
Goal: estimate O(1) terms. Show their independent of p. See more fine statistics about the distribution.
Estimate Koplewit'z numbers for bipartite graph sandpile being cyclic when alpha>1/2 and alpha=1/2
Above computations with digraphs.
